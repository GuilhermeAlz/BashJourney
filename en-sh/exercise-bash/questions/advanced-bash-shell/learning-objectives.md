## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this lab, you will achieve the following:

- **Execute sets of commands using conditional statements:** Understand how to structure conditional statements in Bash and use them to control the flow of commands based on specified conditions.

- **Create true/false comparisons using logical operators:** Learn how to create logical comparisons in Bash scripts using operators such as AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).

- **Utilize arithmetic operators to perform basic mathematical calculations:** Explore the usage of arithmetic operators such as addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`) to perform calculations within Bash scripts.

- **Store and access data using list-like arrays:** Discover how to define and manipulate arrays in Bash, allowing you to store and access multiple values within a single variable.

- **Automate repetitive tasks using for loops:** Learn how to use `for` loops in Bash scripts to iterate over lists of items, perform actions on each item, and automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Exercise 1 - Using conditional statements and logical operators

In this exercise, you will practice writing Bash scripts that utilize conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to control the execution flow based on various conditions.

## Exercise 2 - Performing basic mathematical calculations and numerical logical comparisons

This exercise focuses on performing mathematical calculations and numerical comparisons in Bash scripts using arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and numerical comparisons (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-gt`, `-ge`).

## Exercise 3 - Using arrays for storing and accessing data within for loops

In this exercise, you will learn how to define, populate, and access elements of arrays in Bash scripts. You will also practice using arrays within `for` loops to iterate over array elements and perform tasks based on each element.
