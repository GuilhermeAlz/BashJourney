# Exercise 1 - Using conditional statements and logical operators

## In this exercise, you will create a simple Bash script containing a conditional statement to handle the following tasks:
- Prompt the user for a Yes or No response to a question
- Print a response based on the user's answer

### 1.1. Create a new Bash script
Create a Bash script file and make it executable.

### 1.2. Query the user and store their response
Now get your script to:
- Ask the user a binary "yes or no" question of your choosing
- Store the user's answer in a variable.

### 1.3. Use a conditional block to select a response for the user
Finally, use a conditional block to print a message to the user based on their response to your query.
Tip: It's best practice to also handle the case where the reponse doesn't match any of the allowable responses.
